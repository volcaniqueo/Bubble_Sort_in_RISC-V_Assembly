# Bubble_Sort_in_RISC-V_Assembly
This project was my 1st Assignment for the labs of the course CMPE 344 (Computer Organization) at Bogazici University. This project is an implementation of the classical Bubble Sort algorithm in RISC-V Assembly language.
## About the Project
This project is a implementation of the classical Bubble Sort algorithm. The number of elements in the array (N) and the elements of the array (elements in the V, in the code) themselves are HARDCODED in the code and should be modified whenever necessary.
## To Run the Code
One can search the internet and find one of the many online compilers for the RISC-V Assembly language. Or there is a complete installation guide in the lab's github page. (Just search bouncmpe/labs344 in Github)
